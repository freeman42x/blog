# Why not all life forms are being completely rational?

TLDR:

* the optimal strategy for life forms to not go extinct is to have a mix of rational and irrational agents - this is the equilibrium evolution ended up
* try to be nice to people that are irrational since the reason they are that way is a noble one

Evolution has shaped the behaviours of life forms since a very long time ago. How come after all this natural selection humans did not end up being close to acting totally rational? Especially since being rational and using science is one of the most successful methods humanity has learned to use.

How come even in 2019 we still have so many people that believe the Earth is flat (it's obviously a cube DOH)? There are BILLIONS of people who say they believe in some magical guy in the sky who grants their wishes and punishes people who do not want to be his friends, even though he does nothing to talk to them. There are people who think the moon landings never happened even though there is tons of evidence that it did. There are people that deny the holocaust happened. There are people that deny that global warming is happening. There are people that refuse to vaccine their kids because they think that vaccines cause autism. There are people who will hate you for no reason. There are people who will love you for no reason (lol, can't complain). There are people who code in JavaScript. There are people who think that spending entire day in meetings is one helluva productive day. There are people that think that it is ok for civilians to own guns. There are people that think they should be respected even though they keep spreading non-sense.

There are people...

And animals and other life forms have irrational behaviours also...

## What does it mean to be rational?

A highly rational agent is an agent which almost always chooses an option which is best for achieving its goals. Sometimes there is more than 1 choice that gives optimal probability of achieving its goals, in that case the agent can pick any choice out of those.

## Consider the following scenario that illustrates the problem of having all agents be almost totally rational

There are 2 humans and 1 of them is completely rational while the other one is only partially rational. (this example works with any number of humans, using 2 just to make it easier to comprehend the example)

They both are in the situation of having to leave home and arrive at a specific destination that is quite far (so that taking a car would be preferred to walking to it).

The rational agent will choose to take the car since in this situation that is the option that allows him to achieve his goals as efficiently as possible.

The irrational / partially rational agent decides that he wants to take a walk to its destination (maybe to lose some weight? who knows...).

And here is the key in making the decision:

* life forms are optimizing for the survival of their genes
* and the critical key point is that it is not possible to know the outcome of taking an action - which means that putting all eggs in 1 basket is a sure method to destroy all life forms

In our example it just happens that the most logical option was wrong and the rational agent that took the action had no idea it was a mistake. The car he chose to take to his destination happened to be set up with explosives. He happened to be a very important political figure which had many enemies.

The actions of the person which acted as rational as possible lead to death.

The other person which acted less rationally survived by deciding to walk instead of talking the car.

In simple words:

* the rational person died
* the irrational / partially rational person survived

This shows that acting as rational as possible will not guarantee your survival.

This shows that to achieve optimal probability of not completely extinguishing life forms you want your life forms to make DIFFERENT choices.

The problem with rational agents is that their behaviours tend to converge a lot towards similar solutions - the opposite of DIFFERENT. Evolutionary speaking this is very dangerous since if somehow by making the best choice they get killed that would be a big hit to survival of life forms.

One way to get your evolutionary agents to act differently is to ensure that not all of them are acting completely rationally.

Basically the solution to prevent complete species extinction is to make sure that some agents will act partialy irrationally and only some will be close to completely rational. This ensures that not all agents will act the same, they would act DIFFERENTly. And this is the equilibrum that evolutionary agents reached.

Because the agents would act differently it would be very hard to end up in a situation where all life forms would become extinct.

In simple words: having all the life forms act in an almost perfect rational manner is not an evolutionary stable system for the goal of survival.

The evolutionary stable system for the goal of survival is a mix of all levels of rationality.

## Conclusion - it is ok that not everyone is acting rationally since that is the optimal way to achieve survival

So next time you are arguing with someone irrational remember that it just happened for them to be unlukcy and end up that way - if you were raised in their environment your mentality could have been the same. Some people are born in a poor country in Africa, others are born in rich families. Life isn't fair. Let us try to make life fair since everyone deserves to be treated fairly - it was not their choice to be born poor, not their choice to be born rich, not their choice to be born crippled.

They might say things which will annoy you, maybe piss you off very badly, but do not forget: you could have been them. So be forgiving.

If there is 1 thing that you should remember from this article it is to be gentle with other irrational people since you could have as well been one of them. Try to understand their point of view, try to explain to them your point of view.
