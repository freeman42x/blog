# Haskell static code analysis software

Code improvement suggestions:

* [⭐ HLint - a tool for suggesting possible improvements to Haskell code. These suggestions include ideas such as using alternative functions, simplifying code and spotting redundancies.](https://github.com/ndmitchell/hlint)

Remove dead code:

* [⭐ Unused - command line tool to identify unused code](https://github.com/joshuaclayton/unused#readme)
* [Weeder - detects unused Haskell exports, allowing dead code to be removed](https://github.com/ndmitchell/weeder)
* [Dead code detection - detects dead code](https://github.com/soenkehahn/dead-code-detection#readme)

Formatters:

* [⭐ Brittany - source code formatter, what Haskell IDE Engine uses](https://github.com/lspitzner/brittany/)
* [Ormolu - formatter for Haskell source code](https://github.com/tweag/ormolu)
* [Hident - pretty printer](https://github.com/chrisdone/hindent)
* [Stylish-Haskell - simple Haskell code prettifier](https://github.com/jaspervdj/stylish-haskell)
* [Haskell formatter - formats Haskell source code. It is strict in that it fundamentally rearranges code.](https://github.com/evolutics/haskell-formatter#readme)
* [Floskell - flexible Haskell source code pretty printer](https://github.com/ennocramer/floskell)

Profiling parallel programs:

* [⭐ threadscope - graphical tool for profiling parallel programs](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/threadscope)

Dependency analysis:

* [pkggraph - package dependency graph for installed packages](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pkggraph)
* [Stack - visualize the dependencies between your packages and optionally also external dependencies](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/dependency_visualization/)

Counting lines of code:

* [⭐ cloc - counts blank lines, comment lines, and physical lines of source code in many programming languages](https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc)

Code coverage:

* [⭐ HPC - Code Coverage Library](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hpc)

List exported modules from a set of .cabal files:

* [⭐ lscabal - list exported modules from a set of .cabal files](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lscabal)

Others:
