# Agda dependently typed programming language self-paced study group

## What is Agda?

Agda is a dependently typed programming language. Because of strong typing and dependent types, Agda can be used as a proof assistant, allowing to prove mathematical theorems (in a constructive setting) and to run such proofs as algorithms.

## Study material

We will be going through the [Programming Language Foundations in Agda](https://plfa.github.io/) which is an introduction to programming language theory using the proof assistant Agda.

## Self-paced study

So that as many interested people as possible can benefit from participating in this study in an efficient manner we will have the study be self-paced. This means that there are no deadlines except the ones you will self-impose.

## Editors

Emacs will work with `.lagda.md` files provided by [the official PLFA repository](https://github.com/plfa/plfa.github.io).

Atom only supports the `.lagda` format so use [this fork for the study](https://github.com/razvan-flavius-panda/plfa.github.io/tree/lagda) and check out the `lagda` branch. This was converted from the official source using [a hacky converter](https://github.com/razvan-flavius-panda/LagdaMdToLagda).

## Communication channels

We will be discussing about the study and any questions we might have in the [Haskell Programming Discord Server](https://discord.gg/rfvNXmE).
