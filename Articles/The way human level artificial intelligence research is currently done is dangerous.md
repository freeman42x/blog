# The way human level artificial intelligence research is currently done is dangerous

## Current state of affairs

* Most companies which are currently doing research or implementation targeted at HLAI are using unsafe programming languages:Python, R, Java, etc.
* TODO why they are unsafe

## What we should do

* Start using more safe programming languages such as Haskell, Agda, Idris, etc.
* Create an unified communication platform which would allow HLAI researchers to more efficiently communicate and be made aware of the dangers and benefits of using certain tools for doing HLAI research

Note: HLAI = Human Level Artificial Intelligence = AGI = Artificial Geneneral Intelligence
